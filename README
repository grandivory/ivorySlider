What is ivorySlider?
--------------------
ivorySlider is a jQuery plugin that I created to be a robust and extensible
slider (an in slideshow, not as in an input element). It allows full use of
HTML markup for each slide, customized transitions on a per-slide basis, and
best of all, can be extended by end-users to include their own custom transition
effects!

How to use:
-----------
1. Add ivorySlider.js and ivorySlider.transitions.js to your page
2. Optionally, add in the default styles in ivorySlider.css
3. Create html markup for each slide within a container (usually <ul><li>)
4. After the page has loaded, call .ivorySlider() on your container
